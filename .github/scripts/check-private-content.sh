# check-private-content — gate that fails when staged / changed files
# match a denylist pattern. Per AQS-19 / private-content-firewall.
#
# Usage:
#   check-private-content.sh <file> [<file>...]
#   check-private-content.sh                       # nothing to check; exits 0
#   check-private-content.sh --denylist=<path> ... # override denylist location
#
# Exits 0 if no matches, 1 if any pattern fires (with file:line:pattern
# context on stderr), 2 on configuration error (missing denylist, etc).
